```
  Blind box game gameplay: Players only need to guess a lucky number.
  If they win, they will receive a certain proportion of the current prize pool's bonus.
  If they lose, the bet money will be included in the prize pool.
  The operator can apply for blind boxes from the platform, and can apply for multiple blind boxes.
  The operator can receive a certain proportion of the transaction fee from the player's winning.
 
  Security: The blind box platform is betting a lucky number and generating a hash.
  After the lottery, players and operators can verify that the platform has not cheated by verifying the hash. Similarly,
  players will also generate a hash of the guessed lucky number after placing a bet,
  so It is fair and transparent to platforms, operators, and players.
